__How Braintree Works__
Braintree offers complementary client and server SDKs. They represent the Client-side Encryption solution that combines the best of Braintreeâ€™s traditional Server-to-Server (S2S) approach and the innovative Transparent Redirect (TR) solution. In a nutshell, the Braintree mechanism can be described as following:

1. Your app or web front-end requests a client token from your server in order to initialize the client SDK
2. Your server generates and sends a client token back to your client with the server SDK
3. Once the client SDK is initialized and the customer has submitted payment information, the SDK communicates that information to Braintree, which returns a payment method nonce
4. You then send the payment nonce to your server
5. Your server code receives the payment method nonce from your client and then uses the server SDK to create a transaction or perform other Braintree functions detailed in the guides
